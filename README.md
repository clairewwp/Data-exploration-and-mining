# Data-exploration-and-mining (Project for a team of three people)
In assessment 1, the following tasks were required: 
* Examine the data types
  - Identify the data type
  - Transform the data type to appropriate data type
  - Modify the data type
*Applying suitable statistical measures and functions
  - Identify and report the variables with skewness
  - Identify inconsistencies or errors in hte data, such as missing value and noise
  - Summary the findings during data exploration process
  - Identify a specific value, such as to filter out the location and month of a place where is recorded as having most sunshine and what is the average maximun temperature recorded in a specific location. And recorded the processing steps.
* Utlizing suitable visualization plots
  - Distribution Plot VS Box Plot
  - Identify the corelationship from matplot
  - Identify the highly correlated variable pairs
  - Decide how to treat the highly correlated variables
  - Utlizing a heatmap to show the correlation between numberical variables and summarise the findings
* Selection of data mining tasks and feature selection
  - Identify the most suitible data mining task from classification, clustering or association mining 
  - Justify the variables to be included in this data mining task and identify the roles such as input or target of each variable.

Assessment 2 is to identify useful insight to benefit different industries: Online retails, Health Care and Meteorology.
* Project (a) Applying Association mining to find common ites purchased based on online retail data
  - Identify the required pre-processes on the dataset before building the association mining model
  - Conduct association mining and identify the threshole of minimum support and minimun confidence
  - Identify the top 5 rules and interpret them
  - Identify top 5 common items that customers have purchased along with a specific item
  - Perform sequence analysis
  - Justify how the use of outcome can benefit the decision makers.
* Project (b) Applying Clustering to COVID-19 Epidemiological Data
  - Identify the required pre-processes before building the clustering model
  - Build a clustering model to profile the characteristics of countries
  - Explain what clustering algorithm is used
  - List the attributes used in the analysis
  - Identify the optimal number of identifed clusters and explain how the number is reached. Three approches are used, one is to minimize the intra-cluster distance while maximize the inter-cluster distances using March and April data. Next approch is utlizing the elbow method as it offers the graph that shows how K affect the clustering error. The thrid approch is to calculate silhouette score to compare the similarity of an object to its own cluster to that of other clusters. And finally, pairplots is used to see the distribution to identify the pattern of each group depending on attributes.
  - Decide if normalization is require in this project.
