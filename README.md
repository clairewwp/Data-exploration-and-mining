# Data-exploration-and-mining (Project for a team of three people)
In Assessment 1, the following tasks were required: 
* Examine the data types
  - Identify the data type
  - Transform the data type to the appropriate data type
  - Modify the data type
*Applying suitable statistical measures and functions
  - Identify and report the variables with skewness
  - Identify inconsistencies or errors in the data, such as missing values and noise
  - Summary the findings during the data exploration process
  - Identify a specific value, such as to filter out the location and month of a place that is recorded as having most sunshine and the average maximum temperature recorded in a specific area. And recorded the processing steps.
* Utilizing suitable visualization plots
  - Distribution Plot VS-Box Plot
  - Identify the co-relationship from matplot
  - Identify the highly correlated variable pairs
  - Decide how to treat the highly correlated variables
  - Utilizing a heatmap to show the correlation between numerical variables and summarise the findings
* Selection of data mining tasks and feature selection
  - Identify the most suitable data mining task from classification, clustering, or association mining 
  - Justify the variables to be included in this data mining task and identify the roles such as input or target of each variable.

Assessment 2 is to identify helpful insight to benefit different industries: Online retail, Health Care, and Meteorology.
* Project (a) Applying Association mining to find common items purchased based on online retail data
  - Identify the required pre-processes on the dataset before building the association mining model
  - Conduct association mining and identify the threshold of minimum support and minimal confidence
  - Identify the top 5 rules and interpret them
  - Identify the top 5 common items that customers have purchased along with a specific item
  - Perform sequence analysis
  - Justify how the use of outcome can benefit the decision makers.
* Project (b) Applying Clustering to COVID-19 Epidemiological Data
  - Identify the required pre-processes before building the clustering model
  - Build a clustering model to profile the characteristics of countries
  - Explain what clustering algorithm is used
  - List the attributes used in the analysis
  - Identify the optimal number of identified clusters and explain how the number is reached. Three approaches are used, one is to minimize the intra-cluster distance while maximizing the inter-cluster distances using March and April data. The next approach utilizes the elbow method as it offers the graph that shows how K affects the clustering error. The third approach is to calculate the silhouette score to compare the similarity of an object to its own cluster to that of other clusters. Finally, pair plots are used to see the distribution to identify the pattern of each group depending on attributes.
  - Decide if normalization is required in this project.
