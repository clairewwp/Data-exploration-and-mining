# Data-exploration-and-mining (Project for a team of three people)
In assessment 1, the following tasks were required: 
* Examine the data types
  - Identify the data type
  - Transform the data type to appropriate data type
  - Modify the data type
*Applying suitable statistical measures and functions
  - Identify and report the variables with skewness
  - Identify inconsistencies or errors in hte data, such as missing value and noise
  - Summary the findings during data exploration process
  - Identify a specific value, such as to filter out the location and month of a place where is recorded as having most sunshine and what is the average maximun temperature recorded in a specific location. And recorded the processing steps.
* Utlizing suitable visualization plots
  - Distribution Plot VS Box Plot
  - Identify the corelationship from matplot
  - Identify the highly correlated variable pairs
  - Decide how to treat the highly correlated variables
  - Utlizing a heatmap to show the correlation between numberical variables and summarise the findings
* Selection of data mining tasks and feature selection
  - Identify the most suitible data mining task from classification, clustering or association mining 
  - Justify the variables to be included in this data mining task and identify the roles such as input or target of each variable
